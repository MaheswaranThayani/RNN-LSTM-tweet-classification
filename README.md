This project focuses on building sequence models using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify tweets as either personal health mentions or non-personal health mentions. The dataset consists of labeled tweets that discuss health-related topics, and the goal is to automatically detect whether a tweet reflects a personal health experience. The project implements both LSTM and Bi-LSTM models, along with suitable word embedding techniques. Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation are performed to improve classification accuracy. This work showcases practical applications of deep learning in social media text classification and public health informatics.
